# impossible-loyalty

Draft for an NFT contract to create cards within a loyalty programme. 

The card NFTs are dynamic: points can be added and redeemed for benefits. These operations are only performed by whitelisted operators.

The cards are not transferrable by default. Destinations for transfers can be whitelisted (e.g. it would make sense to transfer the cards to staking contracts)
